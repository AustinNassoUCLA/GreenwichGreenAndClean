PROJECT: Greenwich Green & Clean Non-Profit Website

LANGUAGES EMPLOYED: HTML, CSS, Basic Javascript

DESCRIPTION: This project is the first website that I created completely on my own in Junior year of high school for community service. I designed all of the graphics in Adobe Photoshop and used the slice tool to separate the design and export into web images. I decided to go with a clean design similar inspired by Apple and other clean looking websites popular in 2011.

COMMENTS
--------
As this is my first website, there are obviously a lot of coding inefficiencies that I would do differently now that I have more experience. However, I was really excited about this project and glad to upload a website that worked completely on my own without the use of templates.
